360;Akorbi Mountain View, CA Full Time;UX Research Associate;Californie;Apply Now;"This project will help address one of the main areas of friction for addressing more user harm from Google Play apps. SDKs are a large and common vector of abuse in an app – and when the risk team detects SDKs causing harm, they then work to remediate and enforce on this harm. The remediation and enforcement process includes warning app developers of the SDK issue, recommending they move to compliance, and then removing or suspending apps that continue to be violating policies.
The challenge is that the appeals team in their current process, is limited by capacity to handle appeals from 4-6K app removals each month– which is a hard limitation to acting quickly and in bulk on the harm that we see. If, for example, an SDK’s app impact is 25,000 apps – we are not able to action on these at once or together in a consistent way as we are constrained in time by the appeals capacity.
The hypothesis is that there are low hanging fruit wins that can be addressed in the current appeals process to unlock appeals bandwidth in the short term. There is also an opportunity to understand what other pinpoints that are can be addressed (in the longer term) with engineering (tooling) support. We are asking for a UXR resource that can work alongside the Appeals team to identify these pinpoints and suggest opportunities. This is critical for short term velocity and impact – there is no resource in the Appeals team available for this work (they are all responding to and managing appeals).
Overall Responsibilities:
Map out the user flow of the main uses cases / problems that bring app developers to appeal (related to an SDK issue). Start from the Play developer console experience
· Root cause study of the issues (appeals are the symptoms). This includes detailed analysis upstream, such as:
o How to provide sufficient information to developers upon enforcement so that developer can self-fix the issues without coming to appeals (eg. what information is missing for dev to self-fix issues?)
o How to increase the awareness of SDK violations so that developers are aware that they are required to make fixes while they are not intentionally violating policies
o How to effectively warn developers so that they fix issues in advance to the enforcement
o How to educate developers on technical details (eg. need to roll out updated APK at 100% to deactivate non-compliant APK)
In the user flow, identify the friction areas and the business impact of these friction areas (# staff involved, time to Google and to the app developer, resolution success)
Size (relatively) and prioritize amongst these use cases
Identify opportunities / potential solutions for the main friction points
Capture opportunities for other appeals workflows
After some changes have been implemented, do continuous analysis of the impact and additional areas for improvements
· Compare the original user flow to the new user flow across main use cases
Do a comparison study of metrics
Identify additional opportunities for improvement or adjustment
*Note that if there is bandwidth available, we will also ask UXR to focus on opportunities on handling partner apps within this flow (as a specific use case).
Top Daily Responsibilities:
1. Synthesizing user flow + pain points
2. Identifying and testing risky assumptions
Skill/Experience/Education
Mandatory
o Degree in related field
o 4+ years of experience in UX Research
o Experience in both qualitative and quantitative UX research (qualitative being most important)
o Experience in a product organization
o Portfolio experience in user flows that are in operations
o Must be okay with meetings during APAC time zones at least 2-3 days per week. The rest of the time will be regular working hours in their local time zone for analysis/reporting work.
Desired
o Knowledge about the app ecosystem and app lifecycle
o Experience with Google’s products
o Experience with customer service products
o Can talk to Product, Operations, and Engineering teams

370;Akorbi Mountain View, CA Full Time;UX Research Associate;Californie;$108,160 - $124,800/Year;"This project will help address one of the main areas of friction for addressing more user harm from Google Play apps. SDKs are a large and common vector of abuse in an app – and when the risk team detects SDKs causing harm, they then work to remediate and enforce on this harm. The remediation and enforcement process includes warning app developers of the SDK issue, recommending they move to compliance, and then removing or suspending apps that continue to be violating policies.
The challenge is that the appeals team in their current process, is limited by capacity to handle appeals from 4-6K app removals each month– which is a hard limitation to acting quickly and in bulk on the harm that we see. If, for example, an SDK’s app impact is 25,000 apps – we are not able to action on these at once or together in a consistent way as we are constrained in time by the appeals capacity.
The hypothesis is that there are low hanging fruit wins that can be addressed in the current appeals process to unlock appeals bandwidth in the short term. There is also an opportunity to understand what other pinpoints that are can be addressed (in the longer term) with engineering (tooling) support. We are asking for a UXR resource that can work alongside the Appeals team to identify these pinpoints and suggest opportunities. This is critical for short term velocity and impact – there is no resource in the Appeals team available for this work (they are all responding to and managing appeals).
Overall Responsibilities:
• Map out the user flow of the main uses cases / problems that bring app developers to appeal (related to an SDK issue). Start from the Play developer console experience
• Root cause study of the issues (appeals are the symptoms). This includes detailed analysis upstream, such as:
o How to provide sufficient information to developers upon enforcement so that developer can self-fix the issues without coming to appeals (eg. what information is missing for dev to self-fix issues?)
o How to increase the awareness of SDK violations so that developers are aware that they are required to make fixes while they are not intentionally violating policies
o How to effectively warn developers so that they fix issues in advance to the enforcement
o How to educate developers on technical details (eg. need to roll out updated APK at 100% to deactivate non-compliant APK)
• In the user flow, identify the friction areas and the business impact of these friction areas (# staff involved, time to Google and to the app developer, resolution success)
• Size (relatively) and prioritize amongst these use cases
• Identify opportunities / potential solutions for the main friction points
• Capture opportunities for other appeals workflows
After some changes have been implemented, do continuous analysis of the impact and additional areas for improvements
• Compare the original user flow to the new user flow across main use cases
• Do a comparison study of metrics
• Identify additional opportunities for improvement or adjustment
*Note that if there is bandwidth available, we will also ask UXR to focus on opportunities on handling partner apps within this flow (as a specific use case).
Top Daily Responsibilities:
1. Synthesizing user flow + pain points
2. Identifying and testing risky assumptions
Skill/Experience/Education
Mandatory
o Degree in related field
o 4+ years of experience in UX Research
o Experience in both qualitative and quantitative UX research (qualitative being most important)
o Experience in a product organization
o Portfolio experience in user flows that are in operations
o Must be okay with meetings during APAC time zones at least 2-3 days per week. The rest of the time will be regular working hours in their local time zone for analysis/reporting work.
Desired
o Knowledge about the app ecosystem and app lifecycle
o Experience with Google’s products
o Experience with customer service products
o Can talk to Product, Operations, and Engineering teams

100% Remote

 
A fast-moving, marketing localization agency is seeking an Application Developer to work on:
Updating and significantly enhancing an existing Django codebase application
This is an 'in active client use' application, initially written 5 years ago, which needs updating to 2022 best practices before we add significant new features to it.

New internal project development (most likely Django, but will depend on project requirements)
Replace/rebuild business applications as part of an internal systems upgrade process.

This will be a 'solo developer' position, at least to start with, and we think a good fit would be a more experienced developer who knows that business needs take priority over whatever the latest tech hotness is, and who's comfortable being left to get on with things. They'll be working for a CTO who wants good, maintainable code rather than a 'churn it out quickly' approach.

The Django codebase mentioned above needs a test suite so we'd expect a new hire to spend some time getting familiar with the codebase before making any significant changes. The codebase is not large (originally written by 1.5 developers in 4 months) so is not massively intimidating. Being candid, we expect the first month or two to be a 'clear tech debt' process, before adding any new significant features. The main internal contact for this work will be the CTO, with secondary input coming from internal IT and project management team members.

The internal project development work will cover everything from initial requirements gathering through to project completion. We have a number of old internal systems that need replacing - the new code will need to maintain some amount of compatibility but we're not envisaging a total ""like for like"" swap (e.g. we have some C# desktop apps that will probably end up as Django apps). The contacts for this will include the CTO & CEO (who have extensive knowledge of what we currently have and what we'd like to replace it with) plus other internal contacts for each system.

 

Relevant experience would include:
● Django/Python
● JavaScript, CSS, HTML
● SQL (PostgreSQL)
● Git
● AWS platform experience would be helpful

Skills and attributes
● Proactive, positive and innovative in seeking new solutions and processes
● Strong analytical skills and logical reasoning ability
● Excellent oral and written communication skills

Applicants for employment in the US must have valid work authorization that does not now and/or will not in the future require sponsorship of a visa for employment authorization in the US. We are also unable to do C2C. 

We are an equal opportunity employer and make hiring decisions based on merit. Recruitment, hiring, training, and job assignments are made without regard to race, color, national origin, age, ancestry, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, marital status, disability, or any other protected classification.
