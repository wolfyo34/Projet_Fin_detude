Job Details

Computer vision is at the heart of this platform, and there's a need for a Senior Engineer to help direct a team in this crucial area. The ideal candidate will have strong hands-on experience developing computer vision algorithms that execute on a resource constrained mobile-class processing unit, for use-cases that involve camera localization in a known environment (a platform tennis court) and object detection and tracking in a high motion environment (a training session or game).

What you’ll do:

Work with our senior technical and product teams as well as outside domain experts to make equipment and platform technology choices (cameras, system geometry, proofs-of-concept, testing/validation methodologies, etc.)
Work both independently and cooperatively leading a small team to design and implement computer vision algorithms that accomplish well-defined user-level goals (e.g. localization, tracking, gesture recognition, in/out decisions).
Collaborate with a team of cross-disciplinary engineers (power, hardware, mechanical) while you integrate your algorithms into a resource-constrained computational system where cleverness matters.
Work with web and mobile platform software engineers to seamlessly integrate the work you’ve done with the overall platform, making important decisions about where functionality resides.
